# Lithium
Thanks for checking out Lithium! If you're a writer, I'm sure you'll love to implement this! If you're a beta reader who wants a better reader experience, then look no further for an app to recommend to the author!

## Wait... What the heck is Lithium?
Oh, right. Sorry - forgot our manners! Let's introduce ourselves by answering a few questions you might have.

### What is Lithium?
Lithium is a Google Apps Script program that is designed for writers. But contrary to what you might think this Google Docs extension does, it's not designed to enhance the writing experience - it's actually designed to enhance the reading experience.

### The reading experience?
Yes! The reading experience! Writers often have people who give feedback on their drafts, or just give certain people (like friends and family) early access to their book. Google Docs is an amazing writing suite, but if you're just trying to read something, it's pretty limited. Lithium fixes this by adding amazing features that beta readers and early access members can use - with the push of a button, too!

### Okay, I'm interested. What does it do?
Our main focus is our "Explain Live" feature - it's a pop-out sidebar that shows useful information. It features entries from the themirrazz' [DictionaryXYZ](https://github.com/themirrazz/DictionaryXYZ) dictionary, and it supports displaying any footnotes added via the native Google Docs Footnote feature. It even supports AI Explanations!

### I don't want AI training on my stories!
Ah, I see. Lots of artists - of both images, photos, songs - hate AI for being trained on their data and using it without permission. But we believe that AI can work *with* artists - and this is example. And we try to minimize the possibility of having your data trained on without your permission. Don't believe us? Well then, boy, do we have the document for you: check out the [/AI Explanations Data Policy.md](AI Explanations Data Policy)!

### If you say so... How do I get started?
Just keep reading! Once you have the Google Docs set up for using Lithium, we have an entire document for once you've gotten it installed and are ready to get started *for real*!

## Let's install Lithium to your Document!
### Step 1. Make sure your document is properly prepared.
