# AI Explanations Data Policy
At Lithium, we believe AI and humans can peacefully co-exist. Lots of content creators don't want AI training on their copyrighted content when they don't even get credited. So here's our Data Policy - you can have peace of mind that AI Explanations won't steal your work.

## 1. We don't share your entire book.
Only however much text the user selects, along with canon and lore that you explicitly give to the AI will work.

## 2. We force a character limit.
To prevent your beta readers from feeding the entirety of your hard work into an AI that will regurgitate it, we've implemented a soft limit of 1500 characters. If text selected is 1500 or bigger, the AI Explanations options will not show up.

## 3. We use DuckDuckGo Privacy Layer.
DuckDuckGo has strict contracts with AI model providers, saying that they can't use the data to train the AIs and can only store it as long as they need for security purposes. You can read the DuckDuckGo AI Chat ToS and privacy policy [by clicking this link](https://duckduckgo.com/aichat/privacy-terms).

## 4. The model we have selected is ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is owned by OpenAI, which requires a minimum of keeping chats for 30 days for security reasons, unless they're required by law to keep it for longer.

## 5. Disable AI Explanations if you still don't trust it.
We offer an easy way to disable AI Explanations: just open `Preferences.gs` and set the value of `UXSettings.AIExplanations` to `false`. This will prevent AI Explanations from showing up in the first place!
